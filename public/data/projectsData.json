My proposal was one of the finalists of the competition.",

I settled on simplicity and using the gloves simultaneously as symbols of intimacy and distance, markers of human touch and as well as protection, but in rich colors devoid of the cold medicalized color palette. The concept of touch as a luxury. I chose to hand write the label instead of employing the official font and logo to further add to the air of individualism and reflect the almost D.I.Y. Nature of closeness and protection we had to decide on for ourselves in that time. Touch was one of 2,250 designs to integrate the 14 finalists.",

During months of the creative process, I filmed with my Sony Handycam hi8 in all the residencies, their relevant discussions, auditions, moodboards/ ideas between David and the performers. For this piece, the concept was visually manifesting the difficulty, intensity and frustration of attempting to locate, navigate and unlock the puzzle of the bureaucracy of creation and whether or not the effort is worth the result. I attempted to achieve this through filming details, shadows, close-ups, writing, backstage environments to fashion the visual narrative.",
