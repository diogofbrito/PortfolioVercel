My proposal involved expanding elements of the company logo and color palette, distilling it to a clean, hyper-recognizable format, while in conjunction with constructing stories of each city, highlighted sections of the Leroy Merlin logo that match both graphically and aesthetically to the sentiments of each local retail branch. My proposal was one of the finalists of the competition.",

I was also charged with devising a closure solution for the tubes. I chose to design this as a large-scale, multi-colored, pixellated sticker with flaps that simultaneously functioned as a closure in a bold and highly visible style. Included in the mailer tube with vinyl stage pieces was an insert I designed with graphics related to the sticker which serves to explain the contents.",

Because each event of that cycle was the result of a collaboration between two artists who hadn’t previously worked together, the book serves as a way to capture the ephemeral process as well as the events themselves, incorporating images of gatherings, teaser video stills, reproductions of messages amongst artists and the collective and poster art all framed with text written by guests about the work, visual reference details of the car dealership, full-bleed, color-saturated pages and signature colors. The book was launched in April 2022.",

Embedded behind each click and drag icon users would find thoughtful questions posed and pop-up videos from figures related to the critique of the arts. I added new icons and subsequent questions and video weekly, inviting users to return to the site and expanding the scope of artist’s original concept."

I settled on simplicity and using the gloves simultaneously as symbols of intimacy and distance, markers of human touch and as well as protection, but in rich colors devoid of the cold medicalized color palette. The concept of touch as a luxury. I chose to hand write the label instead of employing the official font and logo to further add to the air of individualism and reflect the almost D.I.Y. Nature of closeness and protection we had to decide on for ourselves in that time. Touch was one of 2,250 designs to integrate the 14 finalists.",

In theory, it is about culture, art and their models of production, representation and support. During months of the creative process, I filmed with my Sony Handycam hi8 in all the residencies, their relevant discussions, auditions, moodboards/ ideas between David and the performers. For this piece, the concept was visually manifesting the difficulty, intensity and frustration of attempting to locate, navigate and unlock the puzzle of the bureaucracy of creation and whether or not the effort is worth the result. I attempted to achieve this through filming details, shadows, close-ups, writing, backstage environments to fashion the visual narrative.",
