			"info": "<i>Percurso</i> is a catalogue raisonné of the work of visual artist José Teixeira, which also tells the story of his life project, Arte da Terra, initiated with his life partner and artist Maria Carvalho in Trás-os-Montes in the 1990s. \n The book has been designed and conceived over the past four years, involving a work of design, text, and visual thought that is intimately related to his life and work. \n I began the design project by observing his visual work.  Teixeira often thematically employed raw materials throughout his work, especially terracotta, earthenware, and iron. The hallmarks of his work: sensitivity, fragility, nature, craftsmanship, I attempted to mirror in the publication as much as possible through the choice of raw, unpolished construction, visible binding, matte, little-processed materials and the inclusion of his iconic <i>average person</i> figure in a niche on the book’s cover, which served both as shorthand to Teixeira’s work and an indicator for the audience of the true scale of his body of work.",

I added new icons and subsequent questions and video weekly, inviting users to return to the site and expanding the scope of artist’s original concept."

I settled on simplicity and using the gloves simultaneously as symbols of intimacy and distance, markers of human touch and as well as protection, but in rich colors devoid of the cold medicalized color palette. \n The concept of touch as a luxury. I chose to hand write the label instead of employing the official font and logo to further add to the air of individualism and reflect the almost D.I.Y. nature of closeness and protection we had to decide on for ourselves in that time. \n <i>Touch</i> was one of 2,250 designs to integrate the 14 finalists.",

During months of the creative process, I filmed with my Sony Handycam hi8 in all the residencies, their relevant discussions, auditions, moodboards / ideas between Marques and the performers. \n For this piece, the concept was visually manifesting the difficulty, intensity and frustration of attempting to locate, navigate and unlock the puzzle of the bureaucracy of creation and whether or not the effort is worth the result. \nI attempted to achieve this through filming details, shadows, close-ups, writing, backstage environments to fashion the visual narrative.",
